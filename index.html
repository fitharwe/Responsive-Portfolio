                    <p> Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I have a bachelors degree in Psychology from Keene State and have worked in medical devices for the past six years. I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire. I am here to change my career and my life! </p>
                        
                    <br>

                        <p> Since I was a kid I've had a knack for computers, starting my journey on DOS. I've found myself as the go to "troubleshooter" for my respective teams during my work experiences. Can't get your computer to turn on/off? Ask Jess. SAP is giving a strange error message? Ask Jess. We need someone to help with validation? Ask Jess. </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>This apptitude for computers continued to grow and, at the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give coding a try. I was surprised to find that coding really was just like the games and puzzles I love to solve. Now, instead of having an indescribable intuition about what to do, I can actually create, edit and design my own content (and understand how and why!). I'm learning the language to go with the instinct, and I am loving it!</p>
